# Spring REST Service
This is a simple RESTful web service with a greeting endpoint wich responds in JSON.<br>
Its purpose is to get started with [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework) and [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).<br>
The project is based on [this](https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/) guide.

### Getting Started
1. Clone this repo
2. Run ```./mvnw spring-boot:run```
3. Open up http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=Guilherme in your browser

This project already has a hot reloading feature, so try to change some code and enjoy it!
